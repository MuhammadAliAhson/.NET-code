The given code is a C# program that performs various mathematical operations and checks for Palindrome and String reverse.

The program starts by displaying a menu with various mathematical operations and checks that can be performed. Based on the user's choice, the program takes input from the user and performs the corresponding operation.

For example, if the user selects option 1, the program takes two integer inputs from the user and performs addition on them, returning the result. Similarly, option 2 performs subtraction, option 3 performs multiplication, option 4 performs modular division, option 5 checks whether the entered number is prime or not, option 6 calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion, option 7 calculates the square root of a given number, option 8 checks whether the entered number is a palindrome or not, and option 9 reverses the entered string.

Overall, this program provides a user-friendly interface to perform basic mathematical operations and checks in C#.
